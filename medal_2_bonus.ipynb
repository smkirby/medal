But really, we want to know is not the overall learning success, but whether a mutant learner is better than the majority learner in the population into which it is born. If it is better, then it has a chance of taking over the population. To figure this out we need to know how well the learner will do if born into a population of other learners who are the same and then compare a mutant to this. If you think about it, this is the diagonal of the table above (i.e. when the mutant **is** the learner that created the stationary distribution). We can extract this as follows:*"

        "*So, it looks like MAP learners invade populations of samplers often, but never the other way around. Also, it looks like samplers that don't match the specific bias of the population die out, whereas that's not so clearly the case with MAP. However, there's a problem with this way of looking at things. This doesn't show us how big an advantage one type of learner has over another, and because these are simulation runs, the results are going to be quite variable and we might have a tiny difference showing up just by chance. Because of this, let's instead plot the results but using a ratio of mutant success to majority success. This will give us an estimate of the **selective advantage** the mutant has. We'll make a new table and ratios and plot this.*"

        "*So, from this plot, we can see clearly that MAP learners will invade sampling populations (the ratios in the bottom left are >1), but not vice versa (the ratios in the top right are <1). Also, there isn't a clear difference between different bias strengths. At least for MAP learners, the strong biases are no more likely to invade the weaker biases. This means that if there is some cost to maintaining a strong bias, or if mutations are likely to degrade rather than strengthen strong biases, we can expect to end up with MAP learners with weak biases. The important point is that weakly biased MAP learners have the same stationary distribution as strongly biased MAP learners. That means that even for cases where we see strong universal patterns in language, we should not expect that to be supported by strong innate constraints. These kinds of constraints are not likely to evolve even if selection is favouring learners who can learn the language of the population they're born into!*"
